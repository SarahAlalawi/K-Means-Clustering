# K Means Clustering
This case-study examines the patterns, symmetries, associations, and causality in a rare but devastating disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The data shows that the rate of ALS progression differs significantly among patients. Also, larger number of the patients die in the age from 3 to 5 after ALS starter; however, a few of the patients are able to survive for over 10 years. We have 2,223 rows and 101 columns in training dataset and 78 rows and 131 columns in testing data set. I trained a k-Means model with different numbers of clusters. The model 3 is the best model with the number of clusters 4. Elbow method gives us an idea to choose the best number of clustering. After evaluation, it was found that, the number of clusters 4 is best for the training but number 3 is best the testing dataset. The silhouette score of model3 and model2 (number of clusters 3) of training dataset is around .35. Based on Davies-Bouldin index, model3 with cluster 4 is better than model2 of training dataset. We canâ€™t see the effectives of the k mean cluster in testing dataset because it has low number of observations. The number of clusters 3 is better than 4 in testing dataset based on silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
